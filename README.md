# hello-hi
Hello! I'm Hayley, a Musical Theatre Performance graduate returning to school in the fall for Creative Industries at Ryerson University. I live for the arts (especially those that take place on the stage) and have been a dedicated singer, dancer, actor, doodler, storyteller, event planner, etc. since I was a small thing. I am thrilled to be entering CI at Ryerson as it seems a perfect program for someone like me who finds herself drawn to so many creative fields that she can't narrow it down! I look forward to getting involved in my program and in the university experience; I know many opportunities will present themselves and I cannot wait to jump on board with them all.
